Tutorial:
grails create-app xyz
cd xyz
grails uninstall-plugin hibernate
grails install-plugin datanucleus-jdo-ldap

grails create-domain-class com.example.User
edit user class:
- edit "table": container of objects
- edit "schema": object classes of objects
- convention: Primary Key must be called "id"
- edit "Column" of id
- add additional attributes
add the FQCN to persistence.xml
grails generate-all com.example.User
grails run-app



Known Issues:
- Must have String field "id" which becomes the RDN
- LDAP doesn't support datastore-identity, thus the id is visible and must be provided.
  It is possible to use a auto-generated id.
- Must manually update persistence.xml
- Transaction handling in generated controllers
